# Mobile Price Range Prediction
## Aim:
To Create a classification model to predict the price range of mobiles based on certain specifications.
## About Dataset:
An entrepreneur has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc. He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, one cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. He wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (e.g., RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So, he needs your help to solve this problem. In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
## ML Algorithms Used:
1. Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features(or inputs), X.
 
2. KNN Classification : KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.

3. SVM Classification : SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine. Consider the below diagram in which there are two different categories that are classified using a decision boundary or hyperplane.
